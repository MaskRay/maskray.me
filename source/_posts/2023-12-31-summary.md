一如既往，主要在工具鏈領域耕耘。

## llvm-project

I made 700+ commits this year. Many are clean-up commits or fixup for others' work.
I hope that I can do more useful work next year.

* Enabled `--features=layering_check` for Bazel's llvm and clang projects
* Implemented `LLVM_ENABLE_REVERSE_ITERATION` for `StringMap`
* Added `llvm::xxh3_64bits` and adopted it in llvm/clang/lld
* Made AArch64 changes to msan and dfsan
* Made various improvements to the clang driver, including `-###` exit code, [auxiliary files](/blog/2023-04-25-compiler-output-files), [errors for unsupported target-specific options](/blog/2023-08-25-clang-wunused-command-line-argument), `-fsanitize=kcfi`, and XRay
* Made various sanitizer changes
* Made `-fsanitize=function` work for C and non-x86 architectures
* Fixed several major problems of assembler implementation of RISC-V linker relaxation
* clangSema: `%lb` recognization for printf/scanf, checking the failure memory order for `atomic_compare_exchange`-family built-in functions, `-Wc++11-narrowing-const-reference`
* llvm-objdump: `@plt` symbols for x86 `.plt.got`, mapping symbol improvements, `--disassemble-symbols` changes, etc
* Supported `R_RISCV_SET_ULEB128/R_RISCV_SUB_ULEB128` for `.uleb128` directives
* gcov: fix instrumentation crashes when using inline variables, `#line`, and `#include`, made llvm-cov gcov work with a smaller stack size
* LTO: fixed local ifunc for ThinLTO, reported errors when parsing module-level inline assembly
* CodeLayout: fixed a correctness bug and improved performance to be suitable for lld/ELF `--call-graph-profile-sort=hfsort` default

Reviewed many commits. A lot of people don't add a `Reviewed By:` tag. Anyway, counting commits with the tag can give an underestimate.
```
% git shortlog -sn 2679e8bba3e166e3174971d040b9457ec7b7d768...main --grep 'Reviewed .*MaskRay' | awk '{s+=$1}END{print s}'
395

Many GitHub pull requests are not counted.

I [created a read-only archive of the LLVM phabricator instance](https://maskray.me/blog/2023-12-30-reviews.llvm.org-became-read-only-archive).

### lld/ELF

lld/ELF is quite stable. I have made some maintenance changes.
As usual, I wrote the ELF port's release notes for the two releases.
See [lld 16 ELF changes](/blog/2023-03-19-lld-16-elf-changes) and [lld 17 ELF changes](/blog/2023-07-30-lld-17-elf-changes) for detail.

I made [some slides](https://gist.github.com/MaskRay/a44a7eb24ba4da029d6bca87b3ae306f) on how I improved the performance of lld/ELF.

## psABI

I have made changes to x86-64, AArch64, and RISC-V psABI documents.

## binutils

Reported many bugs and feature requests:

* [`ld: Should --gc-sections respect RHS of a symbol assignment?`](https://sourceware.org/PR31158)
* [`objcopy: add support for changing ELF symbol visibility`](https://sourceware.org/PR31000)
* [`rtld: resolve ifunc relocations after JUMP_SLOT/GLOB_DAT/etc`](https://sourceware.org/PR30976)
* [`ld riscv: --emit-relocs does not retain the original relocation type`](https://sourceware.org/PR30844)
* [`gas aarch64: GOT relocations referencing a local symbol should not be changed to reference STT_SECTION`](https://sourceware.org/PR30788)
* [`objcopy --set-section-flags: support toggling a flag`](https://sourceware.org/PR30623)
* [`gas x86: reject {call,jmp} [offset func] in Intel syntax`](https://sourceware.org/PR30426)

My commits:

* `PR30592 objcopy: allow --set-section-flags to add or remove SHF_X86_64_LARGE`
* `ld: Allow R_386_GOT32 for call *__tls_get_addr@GOT(%reg)`
* `ld: Allow R_X86_64_GOTPCREL for call *__tls_get_addr@GOTPCREL(%rip)`
* `RISC-V: Add --[no-]relax-gp to ld`

## GCC

I had one patch landed supporting `-mlarge-data-threshold=` for x86-64 `-mcmodel=medium`.

## Linux kernel

8 commits.
Consulted on a number of toolchain questions.

## Blog

Wrote 29 blog posts (including this one, mainly about toolchains) and revised many posts initially written between 2020 and 2023.

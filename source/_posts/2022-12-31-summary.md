一如既往，主要在工具鏈領域耕耘。給這些high-profile OSS貢獻的時候，希望透過這個微小的角度改變世界。

## Highlights

* RELR relative relocation format (glibc, musl, DynamoRIO)
* zstd compressed debug sections (binutils, gdb, clang, lld/ELF, lldb)
* lld/ELF (huge performance improvement, RISC-V linker relaxation, `SHT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES`)
* Clang built glibc (get the ball rolling)
* Make protected symbols work in binutils/glibc
* Involved in sanitizers, ThinLTO, AArch64/x86 hardening features, AArch64 Memtag ABI, RISC-V psABI, etc

<!-- more -->

### RELR relative relocation format

* (In 2021-10, upstreamed `DT_RELR` patch to FreeBSD rtld-elf)
* In April, upstreamed `DT_RELR` patch to glibc (highlighted feature for the 2.36 release)
* In August, upstreamed `DT_RELR` patch to musl (milestone: 1.2.4)
* Upstreamed `DT_RELR` patch to DynamoRIO
* Contributed an unmerged gold patch

Carlos O'Donell [said](https://twitter.com/CarlosODonell/status/1554523273085566982):

> It's exactly that, .rela.dyn is 30x larger than .rela.plt in glibc. I applaud Fangrui Song's efforts here to move DT_RELR forward. If you're going to do one thing that has high impact and move *multiple* communities forward then picking .rela.dyn is the section to pick.

### zstd compressed debug sections

* Added zstd support to gas, ld.bfd, gold, gdb, objcopy, readelf, objdump, addr2line, etc
* Added zstd support to clang, ld.lld, lldb, llvm-objcopy, llvm-symbolizer, llvm-dwarfdump, etc

### lld/ELF

#### RISC-V

陳枝懋 added initial RISC-V support for non-PIC in 2018. I added PIC and TLS support in 2019 ([acknowledgements by lowRISC](https://lowrisc.org/blog/2019/07/risc-v-llvm-backend-in-clang-llvm-9.0/)).
The port was mature but linker relaxation was the last main piece to bring feature parity with GNU ld.
This year I

* Implemented RISC-V linker relaxation ([acknowledgement](https://muxup.com/2022q3/whats-new-for-risc-v-in-llvm-15))
* Implemented `SHT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES` merge support which has a niche value
* Implemented `DT_RISCV_VARIANT_CC`

#### Performance

I spent some weekends improving the performance of lld/ELF this year.
Let's compare an lld 13 built with latest Clang (`/tmp/out/custom0/bin/lld`) with latest lld built with latest Clang (`/tmp/out/custom2/bin/lld`).

Link a `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=on` build of clang 16:
```
lld 13:     Time (mean ± σ):     687.1 ms ±   7.1 ms    [User: 642.6 ms, System: 431.7 ms]
latest lld: Time (mean ± σ):     422.9 ms ±   5.3 ms    [User: 579.8 ms, System: 470.7 ms]

Summary
  'numactl -C 32-39 /tmp/out/custom2/bin/lld -flavor gnu @response.txt --threads=8' ran
    1.62 ± 0.03 times faster than 'numactl -C 32-39 /tmp/out/custom0/bin/lld -flavor gnu @response.txt --threads=8'
```

Link a `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` build of clang 16:
```
lld 13:     Time (mean ± σ):      4.494 s ±  0.039 s    [User: 7.516 s, System: 2.909 s]
latest lld: Time (mean ± σ):      3.174 s ±  0.037 s    [User: 7.361 s, System: 3.202 s]

Summary
  'numactl -C 32-39 /tmp/out/custom2/bin/lld -flavor gnu @response.txt --threads=8' ran
    1.42 ± 0.02 times faster than 'numactl -C 32-39 /tmp/out/custom0/bin/lld -flavor gnu @response.txt --threads=8'
```

This great speedup is achieved by

* Improve internal representation and optimize passes
* Parallelize [section](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120626) and [local symbol](https://reviews.llvm.org/D119909) initialization
* [Parallelize relocation scanning](https://reviews.llvm.org/D133003)
* [Parallelize writes of different output sections](https://reviews.llvm.org/D131247)
* [Process archives as flattened `--start-lib` relocatable files](https://reviews.llvm.org/D119074) (avoid memory accesses to archive symbol tables)
* Parallelize `--compress-debug-sections=zlib`

See [lld 14 ELF changes](https://maskray.me/blog/2022-02-20-lld-14-elf-changes) and [lld 15 ELF changes](https://maskray.me/blog/2022-09-05-lld-15-elf-changes) for detail.
As usual, I wrote the ELF port's release notes for the two releases.

### Clang built glibc (get the ball rolling)

glibc is probably the most prominent OSS which cannot be built with Clang yet.
I sent some patches last year and made a few this year.
See my notes from the last year: [When can glibc be built with Clang?](https://maskray.me/blog/2021-10-10-when-can-glibc-be-built-with-clang#asm-label-after-first-use)

This year Adhemerval Zanella from Linaro maintained a local branch to fix aarch64/i386/x86_64 builds.
I reviewed some of his patches.

It seems that such work will benefit some research projects. For example, Intel FineIBT used a GRTE branch of glibc.

## llvm-project

* C++/ObjC++: switch to gnu++17 as the default standard (fixed many tests)
* `--gcc-install-dir=`: use `clang++ --gcc-install-dir=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/12` to use the selected GCC installation directory. Gentoo uses this (`/etc/clang/gentoo-gcc-install.cfg`) to select the configured GCC installation
* Defaulted to `-fsanitize-address-use-odr-indicator`
* Fixed a long-term bug related to local linkage `GlobalValue` in non-prevailing COMDAT, exposed in (Thin)LTO+PGO
* Fixed some `-fdebug-prefix-map=` issues for debug information for assembly sources
* [Supported](https://reviews.llvm.org/D135045) `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` in Clang
* Helped some opaque pointers migration
* Helped legacy pass manager deprecation

Reviewed many commits. A lot of people don't add a `Reviewed By:` tag. Anyway, counting commits with the tag can give an underestimate.
```
% git shortlog -sn bfc8f76e60a8efd920dbd6efc4467ffb6de15919.. --grep 'Reviewed .*MaskRay' | awk '{s+=$1}END{print s}'
386
```

My number of commits exceeded 4000 this year. Many are clean-up commits or fixup for others' work.
I hope that I can do more useful work next year.

## glibc

27 commits. Some work on the dynamic loader. Notable commits:

* [`elf: Support DT_RELR relative relocation format [BZ #27924]`](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=e895cff59aa562cad83fa0fdd187bfe4b45312d5)
* [`dlsym: Make RTLD_NEXT prefer default version definition [BZ #14932]`](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=efa7936e4c91b1c260d03614bb26858fbb8a0204). When the first object providing `foo` defines both `foo@v1` and `foo@@v2`, `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "foo")` returned `foo@v1` while `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "foo")` returns `foo@@v2`. Now `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "foo")` returns `foo@@v2` as well
* [`elf: Replace PI_STATIC_AND_HIDDEN with opposite HIDDEN_VAR_NEEDS_DYNAMIC_RELOC`](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=098a657fe449a217cf65c5270d5fbc8d40b5b4e6)
* [`elf: Refine direct extern access diagnostics to protected symbol`](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=7374c02b683b7110b853a32496a619410364d70b)
* [`elf: Remove ELF_RTYPE_CLASS_EXTERN_PROTECTED_DATA`](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=de38b2a343e6d64b95c50004943d6107a9e380d0)

The longstanding problem that glibc did wacky things with copy relocations/canonical PLT entries on protected data/functions symbols are correctly unsupported.
I hope that future GCC can stop using indirect access for external protected symbol accesses.
See [Copy relocations, canonical PLT entries and protected visibility](2021-01-09-copy-relocations-canonical-plt-entries-and-protected) for detail.

## Linux kernel

4 commits. Fixed linux-perf when [unwinding ld.lld linked objects](https://git.kernel.org/linus/dc2cf4ca866f571590b65f5e4de06b8c9a302808).
Consulted on a number of toolchain questions.

## Blog

Wrote 25 blog posts (including this one, mainly about toolchains) and revised many posts initially written in 2020 and 2021.

## Misc

I was added as a collaborator of [riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc).

Learned some Jai programming language. It has many exciting ideas.
Solved some algorithm challenges with Nim. Unfortunately my workflow transpiling Nim to standalone C somehow broke later this year.

Trips: Tucson, Greater Los Angeles, Cambridge and Boston, Denver, San Diego, Bellevue and Seattle, Kalispell, Washington, Honolulu.

## Motivation

* Small programs -> single file -> manual compilation

* "not so small" programs
    + many files
    + multiple components
    + more than one programmers

## Motivation - cont.

* Problems
    + harder to manage
    + every change require long compilation
    + division to components is desired

## Motivation - cont.

* Solution - Makefile

## Makefile

* *Makefile* describes
    + project structure
    + instructions for files creation

* A **makefile** consists of many **rules**.

## Rule syntax

> TARGETS: PREREQUISITES

> > RECIPE

* In short, each rule describe instructions (**RECIPE**) to create files (**TARGETS**) with **PREREQUISITES**.

* **PREREQUISITES** are targets must be created prior to **TARGETS**.

* A **target** is considered **old** if its modification timestamp is smaller than one of its dependencies's.

## Makefile -- cont.

* **TARGETS** and **PREREQUISITES** are file names separated by spaces.

* Usually there is **only one** target per rule.

* **TARGETS** and **PREREQUISITES** may contain **wildcards**, e.g. %.c.

* Each line of **RECIPE** starts with a **TAB**.

* The first **rule** indicates the default target (not counting targets that contain wildcards).

## **make**'s mechanism

* **make** command reads a **makefile** and records these rules into its data base.

* **GNU Make** defaults to search **GNUmakefile**, **makefile**, **Makefile** in order, use the first of these which exists.

* The first goal (terminology used to refer to the list of **targets** you specified on the command line) should be created.

* Prerequisites which appeared in the target must be processed first.

* This is a recursive process (depth first search).

* After updating the dependencies , **make** decides whether it is necessary to **recreated** the target.
  This is the case when it is older than one of its dependencies.
  In the case we **recreate** the target, execute the associated recipe.

## **make**'s mechanism - cont.

* **make** virtually construct a dependency DAG (directed acyclic graph).

* **make** ensures **minimum** compilation as long as the project structure is written properly.

* **Do not write** something like:

    > prog: main.c sum1.c sum2.c

    > > gcc –o prog main.c sum1.c sum2.c

    which requires compilation of all project when something is changed

## Automatic variables

* $@
* $^
* $<
* others including $*, $?, $+, $|, $%, $(%D), %(*F), ...

## Example

> convert: cmdline.o convert.o

> > g++ $^ -o $@

> convert.o: convert.cpp convert.h

> > g++ -c $<

> cmdline.o: cmdline.cpp cmdline.h convert.h

> > g++ -c $<

## Equivalent (implicit rules)

* **make** can dedude appropriate recipes according to suffixes

> convert: cmdline.o convert.o

> convert.o: convert.cpp convert.h

> cmdline.o: cmdline.cpp cmdline.h convert.h

## Equivalent (implicit rules) - cont.

> convert: cmdline.o

> convert.o: convert.h

> cmdline.o: cmdline.h convert.h

## Another example

> %.o: %.c

> > gcc -c $<

## Passing parameters

> test: FORCE

> > echo $(VAR)

> FORCE:

* make VAR=hello

* make VAR=world

## Force targets

* Targets without recipes or prerequisites

## Phony targets

* They do not correspond to **real** file.

* Provide some utility, e.g. cleaning intermediate files, archiving the whole project, creating TAGS file for some editors

* Forced to run its recipe upon executing.

## Example

> all : prog1 prog2 prog3

> .PHONY : all

> prog1 : prog1.o utils.o

> > cc -o prog1 prog1.o utils.o

> prog2 : prog2.o

> > cc -o prog2 prog2.o

> prog3 : prog3.o sort.o utils.o

> > cc -o prog3 prog3.o sort.o utils.o

## Practical options of **make**

* -n, print the commands to be run but do not execute them

* -t, touch files instead of running the recipes

* -B, unconditionally make all targets (overide timestamps)

* -W **file**, pretend **file** has been just modified

* -p, print the data base that results from reading the makefiles

* -d, debug mode

* others, RTFM

## Other usage

* **Makefile**'s mechanism is not limited to programs
    + LaTeX sources
    + website deployment
    + describe any task where some files need updating as a result of changes of other files

## Additional features

* Variables (two flavors: simple and recursive, the latter is also called **macros**)
* Functions including string substitution, file name manipulation, **foreach**, even the the root of evil -- **eval**
* VPATH
* Ability to manipulate archives(.a)
* Including other makefiles
* Conditionals
* Secondary expansion
* Order-only prerequisites
* Static patterns
* Double-colon rules
* Target/pattern-specific variable values
